# Machine Learning Example Application
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project that covers the full stack of data analysis, model training, and deployment using FastAPI for the backend API and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend interface. The project walks through the entire process, from building a machine learning model using Python to creating an API for real-time predictions, and a user-friendly frontend for interaction.

## Setup
```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Training
```bash
  python train.py
```

## Running FAST API
```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
```
